Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is used to develop, test and maintain software. Software must be reliable, it is expected that the software will operate without any glitches. Software must be efficient, meaning that it shold makke the work of the developer easier. Software must be scaleable and flexible meaning that there must be room for further development as well as be able to work optimally when there is more traffic. Software must be secure, to ensure users safety, this can be done by ensuring that only relevant people have access.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity
Mastering process
Mastering machine


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The software development lifecycle includes;
Planning: define the purpose and scope of the software
Requirement analysis: Ascertain how the software will be used by users
Design: Creating a framework
Coding: Converting the framework into the actual code
Testing: Make sure the program is functioning as efficiently as possible.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall method
Each phase needs to be completed before the next phase can be completed. This results in the software being unflexible, 
it also means it is hard to make changes after the software has been created. Testing can only be done once development is done.

Agile Method
This methodology uses multiple cycles, it is highly flexible, customer feedback can be taken into consideration at each phase and 
testing is continuously done through each phase.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: This person develops applications, programs and systems using many different programming languages, they are responsible for the 
upkeep of the software, they can calloborate with other team members to ensure best practices and they report to the team leader.

Quality assurance engineer. This person communicates with clients to establish software requirements. They create the development standards and procedures. 
Ensure that software meets its requirements and analyses the product to ensure there are no bugs and that it is running efficiently

Project manager
This person puts the team together. Is the middleman between the client and the system developer. Ensures that project targets are being met.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An Integrated Development Environment is software that allows you to create code in programming languages, The IDE knows the rules for coding in languages and will 
not work if you do not stick to these rules. The IDE can auto-complete code and it uses multiple visual cues to ensure that the code is understandable. It can also 
perform repeatable tasks.
Example: Visual Studio

A Version Control System assists teams in making changes to code. It allows teams to collaborate by working on the same code at the same time. It tracks any changes 
that have been made so that you reference back. It allows you to branch code and merge it when you are done with the changes. It also allows users to go back to the original code, 
if the new code does not work


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenges affecting software engineers include: 
Rapid technological advancements. This can be circumvented by keeping skills up to date.
Time constraints deadlines and high demands can put engineers under pressure, They can break projects into manageable sprints and streamline workflows.
Limited Infrastructure. Not having access to the best software and hardware. Outdated data storage architecture. 
Changing Software requirements. The needs of users at times outpace the software developer's ability to keep software up to date. This can be dealt with by using agile development, This will allow them to break systems up into manageable sizes.
Software security. Ensuring that software is secure and will not fall into the wrong hands. Ensure that software is able to defend itself against hacking, phishing, malware.
Software Accessibility and Usability. Software can sometimes be unfriendly to the people that use it. The solution is to use scalable architecture.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
